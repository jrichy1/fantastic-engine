**Visual Workflow**

Here is a high-level overview of the workflow for this project:
```

  A[Development] -->|code changes|> B[Build]
  B -->|successful build|> C[Testing]

  G -->|prioritized features|> A
```
**Workflow Steps:**

1. **Development**: Make code changes to the project, including writing new code, fixing bugs, and refactoring existing code.
	* Use `git` to manage code changes and collaborate with team members.
	* Follow the project's coding standards and best practices.
2. **Build**: Run `npm run build` to compile and bundle the code using Webpack and Babel.
	* The build process includes:
		+ Transpiling modern JavaScript to older syntax using Babel.
		+ Bundling code into a single file using Webpack.
		+ Minifying and compressing code for production.
3. **Testing**: Run `npm run test` to execute unit tests and integration tests using Jest and Enzyme.
	* The testing process includes:
		+ Writing unit tests for individual components and functions.
		+ Writing integration tests for larger features and workflows.
		+ Running tests in a headless browser environment using Jest.
4. **Code Review**: Review code changes with the team to ensure they meet the project's coding standards and best practices.
	* Use `git` to manage code reviews and collaborate with team members.
	* Follow the project's code review checklist to ensure thorough reviews.
5. **Deployment**: Deploy the built code to production using `npm run deploy`.
	* The deployment process includes:
		+ Building and bundling code for production.
		+ Uploading code to a cloud platform or server.
		+ Configuring environment variables and settings for production.
6. **Maintenance**: Monitor the production environment and gather feedback to inform future development.
	* Use logging and monitoring tools to track errors and performance issues.
	* Gather feedback from users and stakeholders to inform future development.
7. **Backlog**: Manage feature requests and prioritize them for future development.
	* Use a project management tool to track feature requests and prioritize them.
	* Follow the project's prioritization framework to ensure alignment with business goals.

**Notes:**

* The workflow is triggered by code changes in the development environment.
* The build and testing steps are automated using a CI/CD pipeline.
* Code reviews are performed manually by the development team.
* Deployment is automated using a CI/CD pipeline.
* Maintenance involves monitoring production logs and gathering feedback from users.
* The backlog is managed using a project management tool and prioritized using a framework.

**Tools and Technologies:**

* `git` for version control and collaboration.
* `npm` for package management and dependency installation.
* `Webpack` and `Babel` for building and bundling code.
* `Jest` and `Enzyme` for testing and debugging.
* `ESLint` for linting and code quality enforcement.
* `CI/CD pipeline` for automating build, testing, and deployment.
* `Project management tool` for managing feature requests and prioritization.
